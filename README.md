## Features

### Dashboard
- **Live local weather card** for Tangerang with real-time clock, AQI bar, humidity, wind, pressure, UV index, and a 10-slot scrollable hourly forecast

- **Indonesia Overview carousel** — auto-rotating Indonesian cities with same detailed metrics and interactive dots
- **Indonesia map display** — embedded Indonesia map with temperature-colored city pins and legend

### World Map Tab
- **Overview carousel on top** — auto-rotating city selection with stats (same as dashboard Global Overview)
- **Full-screen world map** with react-simple-maps + Natural Earth TopoJSON (110m resolution)
- **Interactive city pins** colored by temperature (blue → green → amber → red scale)
- **Animated pulse ring** on selected city from carousel or legend
- **Temperature scale legend** on the right with all 24 tracked cities listed by temperature
- Click any city in legend to instantly select it in the carousel above

### 🇮🇩 Indonesia Tab
- **Overview carousel on top** — auto-rotating Indonesian city selection with stats

- **8 major Indonesian cities** with interactive pins and animated hover effects
- **Temperature scale legend** on the right with all cities listed by temperature  
- Click any city in legend to instantly select it in the carousel above
- Consistent layout matching World Map tab for uniform user experience

### Weather Alerts
- Auto-generated alerts for: extreme heat (≥38°C), freezing (≤0°C), thunderstorms, high UV, poor air quality, strong winds, high humidity
- Side-by-side **city comparison table** with temperature color coding
- **World extremes board** — hottest, coldest, windiest, most humid, best air quality

### UI/UX
- **Dark / Light mode** toggle — full theme switch via CSS custom properties
- **°C / °F unit toggle** — converts every temperature across all components simultaneously
- Glassmorphism card system with backdrop blur
- Smooth card transitions, micro-animations, and hover states throughout
- Fully responsive layout — collapses gracefully on smaller screens

## Architecture Decisions

### Why CSS custom properties over a CSS-in-JS library?
The entire dark/light theme is powered by two sets of CSS custom properties (`.dark` and `.light` classes on the root `<div>`). Toggling themes is a single `className` swap — zero JavaScript overhead at runtime, no hydration flicker, and full IntelliSense in the IDE. Every color, background, border, and shadow references a variable, making the system trivially extensible.

### Why `react-simple-maps` over a canvas-based library?
SVG-based maps integrate naturally with React's rendering model. Each `<Geography>` and `<Marker>` is a real DOM node — meaning React's reconciler handles updates, you get full CSS/animation support, and interactive states (hover, click, selection) are just component props. No imperative canvas API calls.

### Why a single `styles.css` over CSS Modules or Tailwind?
For a dashboard of this scope, a single well-organized stylesheet with BEM-like class names gives the clearest mental model. CSS Modules would require importing per-component and managing class composition across shared elements. Tailwind would bloat the JSX and obscure the design intent. The current approach keeps components readable and styles co-located in one auditable file.

### TypeScript strictness
`tsconfig.json` enables `strict: true`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, and `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`. The project passes `tsc --noEmit` with zero errors. All weather condition strings are typed as a union literal (`WeatherCondition`) rather than `string`, and temperature unit is `'C' | 'F'` — not a boolean — making future i18n or unit additions safe.

### State management
All state lives in `App.tsx` and flows down via props. The app has no global store (Redux, Zustand, Jotai) because the data graph is shallow and the state surface small. `unit` and `darkMode` are the only truly global concerns — both are simple `useState` values passed as props, which is idiomatic React for an app of this complexity. Adding a store later is a clear upgrade path if the data layer grows.
